### Description
ColorChanger class provided by professor. Color changer will change the hue of an image (default hardcoded for flower.png) at a certain hue value (default hardcoded as a float of 90/360.0f) and outputs the change as a new image. Most of the code has been completed already and just requires bitwise operations to get specific value of the red, green, and blue color values that are in an ARGB integer representation. In addition there are several tests that ran to cover different hue spectrums as seen in the instruction sheet with respectively different output names to reflect each different hue applied to flower.png.
